Welcome to a deep dive into the world of mental health and social contagion in Gen Z and college students. This website will walk you through the many ways pop culture affects our mental health through social contagion. From fashion, to music, to TV and everything in between, we hope you learn how group think through modern pop culture affects college students in our world today. 

This site's sample collection comprises a set of objects, each of which is represented by one or more images. The collection items in this demo are from The Museum of Islamic Art, Qatar, (courtesy of [WikiMedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Google_Art_Project_works_in_The_Museum_of_Islamic_Art,_Qatar) and [Google Art Project](https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/about/artproject/)) and The Qatar National Library (via [World Digital Library](https://www.wdl.org/en/)).
