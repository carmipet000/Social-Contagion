title: Mental Health and Social Contagion Within College Students
permalink: /about/
---
Through this project, our group wishes to answer several questions about mental health in relation to popular culture. We’re interested in exploring how social media affects mental health, and how social contagion contributes to it. We’re also interested in discovering how our own conceptions of mental illness affect how we approach our problems, for college students in particular. Mental health is a huge part of pop culture, especially as it is becoming more of a normalized subject to talk about in our world today. At Indiana University, many students struggle with mental health, and there are many ways that social media and modern pop culture affect it. Looking into these aspects of pop culture and how they affect us and centering our project around them will both help spread mental health awareness and give easy access to mental health resources around campus.
