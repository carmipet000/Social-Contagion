The mental health in pop culture project was a group effort run by Peter Carmichael, Delaney Casse, and Mel Goldstein. Delaney did the collaboration memo, Peter did the website producing and image finding, and Mel did the writing. The goal of this project was to create a space for anyone who is interested to become more aware of the connection between mental health, pop culture, and social contagion.
