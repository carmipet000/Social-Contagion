**Week 4**

January 31st

In class we discussed possible topics that we could use for our project. After ruling out topics we were not as interested in, we decided to center our project on mental health on mental health in relation to pop culture, and how social media affects mental health as well.

February 2nd 

We started off our meeting by choosing a specific angle for our project which is social contagion, because we think a big part of social media and pop culture is centered around this idea and it definitely has an impact on mental health. This was a good turning point in our project making process because it felt like our plan was secure. 

**Week 5**

February 7th

We started looking at our Exhibition Proposal. We decided the name of our project would be “Mental Health in Popular Culture at IU”. We focused heavily on the description of the project on this day so we had a clear outline. We want to show how we approach mental health problems through photos and also explain how social contagion relates to the way we handle our mental health, as social media and pop culture are such a large part of our society. 

February 9th

As we continued our outline, we focused on the significance of our project today. We wanted to make sure to emphasize the importance of mental health especially in this modern day and age, and the best way we believed we could do that was by doing this project and examining the mental health resources here at IU. We also looked further into the timeline of this project and made sure each person knew their job (Mel writing, Delaney technician, Peter producing). Any work that isn’t directly related to a job we will split up evenly. 

**Week 6**

February 14th

Today we discussed images for the project. We want to include a wide variety of photos because there is so much to cover in our project. We want to make it clear that popular culture directly affects mental illness, and we want to show that through a simple graphic. We also want to give insight as to how social media and pop culture change affect our mental health, possibly through fashion, music, and television. To connect it to IU, we thought of reaching out to someone in the psychology department for a quote and possibly asking students around campus their thoughts.  

February 16th

We did not meet today because two of us were out sick. 


**Week 7**

February 21st

This was the week we started working on the project. We basically just did a check in on how everyone was doing with their individual jobs. It was a pretty quick meeting and we just went over the photos we had so far. 

February 23rd

This was another check in. To make sure we were on track, we went through the project outline and made sure everything we put in the project was relevant to the information we wanted to give to our audience. 
                                   
**Week 8**

February 28th

We didn’t meet today because not all of us were there, but we did a quick check in over text about what everyone was up to as far as their individual jobs. 

March 2nd

Today we met in class and went through the images we had so far. We made some changes to the picture descriptions to tie it more into our project. We also discussed how to incorporate more information that was relevant to IU into our project.   


**Week 9**

March 7th  

March 9th

As a group we continued to search for images that we thought were good at explaining the topic that we picked. We didn’t meet for very long today but we did a lot of work on our own.

**Week 10 Spring Break**

**Week 11**

March 21st

We were just getting back in the groove of things because of spring break because we took a break but we are continuing to make the descriptions really stand out and explaining the image.             

March 23th

We talked over the phone because some of us were sick and could not make it into class. We got most of the images done and the descriptions. 

**Week 12**

March 28th

We are continuing to work on the excel sheet in class and get all the information needed for it to be complete on the 30th.                                          

March 30th

Finalized topic question: How does social media and modern day pop culture affect college students' mental health through social contagion?
Image structure in response: different photos of pop culture (fashion, social media, music, trends, demographics, psychology such as placebo effect and nocebo effect)

**Week 13**

April 4th

As a group we collaborated on images and descriptions to make the project better for the viewers eyes.  

April 6th

We continued to finish up some big parts of our project that pull everything together into one. We are not mostly working on the website itself.


**Week 14** 

April 11th

We discussed the things that we still needed to get done for upcoming classes. We made a schedule so that we would not fall behind in classes. 

April 13th

On this day we were all absent and did not meet in class, but we texted in our group chat and figured out what needed to be done individually. 


**Week 15** 

April 18th

We were all present and are working on the project as a class. We were looking at the layout as well as the information that is needed for each tab. We went through how to edit the data on github as a class.

April 20th

We all were in class working on the project including the new paragraphs that need to be added to the home page and other parts. We are slowly getting the hang of the technology and the different aspects of it despite it being really hard to figure out. We are all coming together to get a great end result. 

**Week 16**

April 25th

We continued to work on the project and started to finalize everything for the due date coming soon. We talked about what else needed to be done. We fixed the metadata record  

April 27th 

We were able to ask you questions about steps that we needed to take to finalize the website itself. We were able to submit the project and get everything that needed to be done.
