All of the photos in this collection are different examples of modern day pop culture that have had a large impact on Gen Z, especially college students. Many of these pop culture examples have contributed somehow to our mental health through the idea of groupthink and social contagion. Social contagion is the tendency for people to mirror the behavior of others that they have been exposed to. From social media apps like tik tok, instagram, and snapchat, to the craziest of trends such as eating tide pods, our examples of pop culture in the media show that one small trend or app can spread like wildfire. But how does this affect our mental health? Does the internet come at the cost of college students' happiness and wellbeing? College students get exposed to different types of media in pop culture throughout everyday life, and though many times these things can be beneficial, they are also detrimental to our health. The photos shown are different demonstrations of things in everyday life that create mental health issues within college students and are extremely impactful through social contagion.
