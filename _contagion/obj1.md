description: Popular culture clearly affects our conceptions of what mental illness
  is. This is important, as our conceptions have been proven to have a powerful impact
  on our health. First demonstrated by John Haygarth, the Placebo effect refers to
  the fact that if a patient believes a drug is the cure for their disease, they will
  experience a measurable reduction in their symptoms.
