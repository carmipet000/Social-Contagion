description: Now that weâ€™ve established that perceptions influence us in psychologically
  significant ways, we can look at examples where this quirk was used to propagate
  unhealthy behaviors. One such example was in the St. Vitus Dance. People affected
  by this contagion would dance themselves to exhaustion, and then get up to dance
  some more. Many danced themselves to death.
